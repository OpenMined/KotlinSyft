# KotlinSyft
KotlinSyft makes it easy for you to **train and inference PySyft models on Android devices**. This allows you to utilize training data located directly on the device itself, bypassing the need to send a user's data to a central server. This is known as [federated learning](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/federated-learning-collaborative.html).

- :gear: **Training and inference** of any PySyft model written in PyTorch or TensorFlow
- :bust_in_silhouette: Allows all data to stay on the user's device
- :back: Support for delegation to background task scheduler
- :key: Support for **JWT authentication** to protect models from Sybil attacks
- :+1: Host of **inbuilt best practices** to prevent apps from over using device resources. 
    - :electric_plug: **Charge detection** to allow background training only when device is connected to charger
    - :zzz: **Sleep and wake detection** so that the app does not occupy resource when user starts using the device
    - :money_with_wings: **Wifi and metered network detection** to ensure the model updates do not use all the available data quota 
    - :no_bell: All of these smart defaults are easily are **overridable**
- :mortar_board: Support for both reactive and callback patterns so you have your freedom of choice (_in progress_)
- :lock: Support for **secure multi-party computation** and **secure aggregation** protocols using **peer-to-peer WebRTC** connections (_in progress_).

There are a variety of additional privacy-preserving protections that may be applied, including [differential privacy](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-differential-privacy-85ce191e198a), [muliti-party computation](https://www.inpher.io/technology/what-is-secure-multiparty-computation), and [secure aggregation](https://research.google/pubs/pub45808/).

[OpenMined](https://openmined.org) set out to build the **world's first open-source ecosystem for federated learning on web and mobile**. KotlinSyft is a part of this ecosystem, responsible for bringing secure federated learning to Android devices. You may also train models on iOS devices using [SwiftSyft](https://github.com/OpenMined/SwiftSyft) or in web browsers using [syft.js](https://github.com/OpenMined/syft.js).

If you want to know how scalable federated systems are built, [Towards Federated Learning at Scale](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.01046.pdf) is a fantastic introduction!

## Installation
We have not currently made our initial release. KotlinSyft would soon be available on JCenter and Maven.

## Quick Start
As a developer, there are few steps to building your own secure federated learning system upon the OpenMined infrastructure:

1. :robot: Generate your secure ML model using [PySyft](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft). By design, PySyft is built upon PyTorch and TensorFlow so you **don't need to learn a new ML framework**. You will also need to write a training plan (training code the worker runs) and an averaging plan (code that PyGrid runs to average the model diff).
2. :earth_americas: Host your model and plans on [PyGrid](https://github.com/OpenMined/PyGrid) which will deal with all the federated learning components of your pipeline. You will need to set up a PyGrid server somewhere, please see their installation instructions on how to do this.
3. :tada: Start training on the device!

**:notebook: The entire workflow and process is described in greater detail in our [project roadmap](https://github.com/OpenMined/Roadmap/blob/master/web_and_mobile_team/projects/federated_learning.md).**

You can use KotlinSyft as a front-end or as a background service. The following is a quick start example usage: 

```kotlin
    val userId = "my Id"
    
    // Optional: Make an http request to your server to get an authentication token
    val authToken = apiClient.requestToken("https://www.mywebsite.com/request-token/$userId")

    // The config defines all the adjustable properties of the syft worker
    // The url entered here cannot define connection protocol like https/wss since the worker allots them by its own
    // `this` supplies the context. It can be an activity context, a service context, or an application context.
    val config = SyftConfiguration.builder(this, "www.mypygrid-url.com").build()
    
    // Initiate Syft worker to handle all your jobs
    val worker = Syft.getInstance(authToken, configuration)
    
    // Create a new Job
    val newJob = syftWorker.newJob("mnist", "1.0.0")
    
    // Define training procedure for the job
    val jobStatusSubscriber = object : JobStatusSubscriber() {
        override fun onReady(
            model: SyftModel,
            plans: ConcurrentHashMap<String, Plan>,
            clientConfig: ClientConfig
        ) {
            // This function is called when KotlinSyft has downloaded the plans and protocols from PyGrid
            // You are ready to train your model on your data
            // param model stores the model weights given by PyGrid
            // param plans is a HashMap of all the planIDs and their plans. 
            // ClientConfig has hyper parameters like batchsize, learning rate, number of steps, etc
            
            // Plans are accessible by their plan Id used while hosting it on PyGrid.
            // eventually you would be able to use plan name here 
            val plan = plans["plan id"]

            repeat(clientConfig.maxUpdates) { step ->
                // your custom implementation to read a databatch from your data
                val batchData = dataRepository.loadDataBatch(clientConfig.batchSize)
                // plan.execute runs a single gradient step and returns the output as PyTorch IValue
                val output = plan.execute(
                    model,
                    batchData,
                    clientConfig
                )?.toTuple()
                // The output is a tuple with outputs defined by the pysyft plan along with all the model params
                output?.let { outputResult ->
                    val paramSize = model.modelState!!.syftTensors.size
                    // The model params are always appended at the end of the output tuple
                    val beginIndex = outputResult.size - paramSize
                    val updatedParams =
                            outputResult.slice(beginIndex until outputResult.size - 1)
                    // update your model. You can perform any arbitrary computation and checkpoint creation with these model weights
                    model.updateModel(updatedParams.map { it.toTensor() })
                    // get the required loss, accuracy, etc values just like you do in Pytorch Android
                    val accuracy = outputResult[1].toTensor().dataAsFloatArray.last()
                } ?: handleEmptyOutput() // This means the plan wasn't built properly 
            }
        }

        override fun onRejected(timeout: String) {
        // Implement this function to define what your worker will do when your worker is rejected from the cycle
        // timeout tells you after how much time you should try again for the cycle at PyGrid
        }

        override fun onError(throwable: Throwable) {
        // Implement this function to handle error during job execution 
        }
    }
    
    // Start your job
    newJob.start(jobStatusSubscriber) 
    
    // Voila! You are done.
```

### Running the Demo App
The demo app fetches the plans, protocols and model weights from pygrid server hosted locally. The plans are then deserialized and executed using libtorch.
<p align="center">
<img src="project_resources/demo.gif" height="354">
</p>

Follow these steps to setup an environment to run the demo app:

- Clone the repo [PyGrid](https://github.com/OpenMined/PyGrid) and change directory to it
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenMined/PyGrid
cd PyGrid
```
- Install [docker](https://github.com/OpenMined/PyGrid/#getting-started)
- Install docker-compose.
- Execute `docker-compose` in the command line to start pygrid server.
```bash
docker-compose up
```

- Install [PySyft](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft) `v0.2.5` in the virtual environment.
```bash
virtualenv -p python3 venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install syft==0.2.5, jupyter==1.0.0, notebook==5.7.8
```
- Host Jupyter Notebook 
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
- Open a browser and navigate to [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888/). You should be able to see the pysyft notebook console.
- In the Jupyter Notebook, navigate to `examples/experimental/FL Training Plan`
- Run the notebooks `Create Plan`. It should save three files in the `FL Training Plan` folder
- Run the notebook `Host Plan`. Now PyGrid is setup and the model is hosted over it.
- The android app connects to your PC's localhost via router (easier approach)
- Get the IP address of your computer by running `ip address show | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1` if using Linux/Mac. For windows there are different steps. Alternatively, if you want to run the demo app in the emulator, use `10.0.2.2` as the IP address.
- Create a file `local_config.properties` under the folder `demo-app` and add the following line:

```
syft.base_url="<IP_address_from_step_16>:5000"
```

### Training Dataset
The demo app has a smaller randomly sampled subset of MNIST Training Data. You can replace the `demo-app/src/main/res/raw/mnist_train.csv` with the 100MB file from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oHegwSc9pDFQDZe0FeKW51-SQsTz4i3W/view?usp=sharing)

Download the above file and replace it with `train_mnist.csv` to train on complete mnist data.
