# Contributing Guidelines

We would be happy to have more volunterers for the android worker. This library constitutes and important component of on-device machine learning and you will be a part of this huge community
You can always join us on slack if you find an issue in which you are interested.

Here are some important resources:

  * [Openmined.org](https://www.openmined.org/) describes the role and long term aim of the organisation,
  * [Pysyft](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft) repository is the hub of all encrypted algorithms and training protocols. The android worker acts as a client for it! 
  * [Syft.js](https://github.com/OpenMined/syft.js) is the web interface for Pysyft
  
## Testing 

The library is in the initial stages and we would like to build a complete suite of tests. Till then we can only test functionality 

## Submitting Pull Requests

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to KotlinSyft](https://github.com/OpenMined/KotlinSyft/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Please Squash your commits into one before sending the pull request. 

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

* Please use the android code reformat **on the VCS changes** before the final commit.
* Ensure Indent Detection is on on Android Studio

Thanks,
